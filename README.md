Created to help scientists at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov/) analyze point cloud data from different pieces of equipment including but not limited to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
Data is loaded in as CSV files, which then produces a three dimensional scatter plot and a two dimensional plane.

Using any compatible SteamVR controller, the plane can be scanned over the data cloud to produce a sonified result heard in the speakers, the sound emitters are ambisonic so the experience is much better with headphones. The texture and variety of the sound can tell scientists if the equipment is calibrated correctly, this tool assists in setting that calibration.
